1) a wallet creates a factory, this person is the owner of the factory and is the first yk creator
2) when creating a dao, first a top dao has to be created
3) the first yk will also be the yk of this dao, this dao is the sr dao and is the top of the hiearchy
4) when a dao is created
	4-a) the factory becomes the owner of the dao
	4-b) the factory gets all 1000 voter and yk tokens
	4-c) the factory can mint as many tokens as they want the otken is mintable and the function for such stuff will be added later
	4-d) the dao then gets allowance to use 1000 voter and yk tokens from factory
	4-e) dao uses this allowance completely and gets all the yk and voter tokens for itself
5) inside dao
	5-a) the creator, yk has 1000 tokens in the mapping, he can withdraw them and deposit them (our token logic is faulty, we have to fix this)
	soyle yapilabilir belki: iste bu yk icin ayri mapping olmus olur, insanlar bu dao ya uyeyse direk dao dan tokenlerini alirlar yada yk lar dagitir iste withdrawlayip sendlerler
	sonrasindada direk token harcamali yeni bir logic yazabiliriz very easy olur bakalim
